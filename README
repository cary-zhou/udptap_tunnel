udptap - create TAP device that sends/receives UDP packets to/from configured host.
Supports encryption using mcrypt.

Usage: udptap_tunnel <localip> <localport> <remotehost> <remoteport>
    Environment variables:
    TUN_DEVICE  /dev/net/tun
    DEV_NAME    name of the device, default tun0
    
    MCRYPT_KEYFILE  -- turn on encryption, read key from this file
    MCRYPT_KEYSIZE  -- key size in bits, default 256
    MCRYPT_ALGO     -- algorithm, default is twofish. aes256 is rijndael-256
    MCRYPT_MODE     -- mode, default is CBC


Note that each packet is encrypted separately and there is no filtering of invalid packets. Replay-based attacks will work.
Transferring some file using this tunnel's encryption feature is less secure than encrypting the file and then transferring it.

The project is named "udptap_tunnel" because of there is already other udptap on Github.

For a tool that does not use UDP sockets, but directly sends to Ethernet interface see https://github.com/vi/tap_mcrypt
